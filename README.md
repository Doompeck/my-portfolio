# my-portfolio

## Description

This project was built to begin getting my work out and on display.  There is the problem of wanting to be a web developer and having nothing to showcase.  With this I begin to build a collection of work to showcase to prospective customers and employers.  I learned that I still have to get more comfortable with my code and put down my want to be a perfectionist.
